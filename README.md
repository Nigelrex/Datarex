## What is Datarex?

Datarex is a wrapper around better-sqlite3, which provides a simple, easy to use, and powerful SQLite database. All in control of your hands

With the power of Javascript Map and the persistant storage of your data, you can create a database that can be used by any application.

### Why Datarex?

Datarex is much better than other better-sqlite3 wrappers, because it has a Map-like interface, which makes it easy to use. And can be turned off anytime per table. This helps you save on Memory when it runs low and turn it back on for much faster database access.
